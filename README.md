# my-cost-note
A daily cost management system using django: https://my-cost-note.herokuapp.com/

Here is a real life application build with django, bootstrap-4, ajax.

This application will manage your all cost things automatically.

You/Your partner will be able to:
```
1. Add cost  
2.Search cost  
3.See total cost till now  
4.See total cost of current month  
5.Chat with your partners  
6.Restriction to other people  
7.Download pdf file of cost list  
8.And a lot..  
```

I need to have an application like this. And finally i make it. It's live now. You can test also.

Cheers!
